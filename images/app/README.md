# App Screenshots Directory

This directory needs to contain the following screenshots of your MemoRaid application:

1. `daily-exercises.jpg` - Screenshot showing the daily exercises interface
2. `progress-tracking.jpg` - Screenshot showing user progress analytics
3. `memory-journal.jpg` - Screenshot showing the memory journal feature
4. `caregiver-connection.jpg` - Screenshot showing the caregiver connection interface

Please add your actual app screenshots with these filenames for the animation to work correctly. For best results, use screenshots with:

- Resolution: 1080Ã—2340 pixels (or similar phone aspect ratio)
- Format: JPG or PNG
- High quality, no compression artifacts
- Consistent UI style across all screens
